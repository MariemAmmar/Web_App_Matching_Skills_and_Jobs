The IT industry is constantly evolving, which makes it difficult for their students to understand which skills they need to acquire for a particular job. The students have several questions, such as whether they need to learn C++ to become a data scientist or if they can use JavaScript for data analytics. The client has requested us to develop a data-driven solution that will help their students understand the relationship between different jobs and technologies.
